# [CameronDoyle.co.uk](https://camerondoyle.co.uk)

camerondoyle.co.uk is a single-page portfolio website for, unsurpisingly, **Cameron Doyle** (that's me). It also houses my personal blog, which is updated as and when I remember.

The site is generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and the design is based on the [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) template, which is itself based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat).
