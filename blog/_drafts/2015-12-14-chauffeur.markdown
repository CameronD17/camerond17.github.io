The past weekend marked the last of the travelling for this calendar year, driving down south to Leeds for a friend's 30th birthday (I do usually go to more exotic locations, honest).

Despite knowing about the event since about April, we left planning until the last minute as usual. By the time we got around to looking into logistics, hotel prices were sky-high, and trains were all but unavailable. Typical.

Undeterred, we decided to just drive down and back in one night, stopping off at home in Newcastle on the way. Unusually for me, I was passenger for this trip; ordinarily, I don't like being driven places, I much prefer driving myself. I find it calming and therapeutic (although most people who've been in my car would shake their head incredulously at that statement.)

### Rain

The main impression I took from my time in Leeds was that it rains. A lot. Now, I know that 10 hours is nowhere near enough time to judge a city, but the sheer level of water in that city was unbelievable. 
On more than one occasion, I genuinely thought we must have flooded the engine after driving through innocuous looking puddles that turned out to be bonnet-high [flood water]. 

Nevertheless, we steadfastly soldiered on and met a long-time friend of ours who had offered to give us a whistle-stop tour of the city, and our perseverance was rewarded with a bonny walk around the Leeds Christmas Markets (although I have to say Edinburgh still hosts my favourite markets.)
