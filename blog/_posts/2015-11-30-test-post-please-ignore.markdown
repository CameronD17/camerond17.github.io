So. Blogging. Historically, not something I've ever been very good at. I always enjoyed building the blog or writing the code more than filling the pages with beautiful prose. Hey, that was almost Seuss-like!

Anyway, this post is primarily to test that my links and code works nicely with [Jekyll][jekyll] (which I love, by the way. I am so annoyed at myself for not discovering it sooner.) 

I'm even going to let you in on a secret; this post was written on December 12th, but it's dated November 30th so I can test that my dates categorise themselves properly. Ho ho, I am such a rebel.

I don't really have much else to say here. I'm going to leave this post up, for posterity so I can look back on it fondly in 2020 when I write my thousandth post (yeah, right). Is there anything else I should be testing? Oh right, images!

Well, on the off-chance that I give my site a total overhaul by the time you come to read this, people-of-the-future, below is a screenshot of what my blog looked like when I wrote this post:

I think this is long enough now to qualify as a full post. I'm not going to count the words, but I imagine this will trigger the page-length-in-minutes counter!
